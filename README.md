# W2 Project - Data cleaning & wrangling

### PROJECT ABOUT PANDAS

![panda.jpg](attachment:panda.jpg)

The first project in ironhack has been an analysis of global shark attacks. For this we have used `Python`, which is a necessary tool to be able to sort the data and extract those that are useful. 

We have extracted a csv with data that was out of order and repeated, so we have had to clean it up and keep those that are useful.

### Library
The main libraries that we have used have been `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` and `re`, which have allowed me to perform functions for cleaning and subsequent visualization.

### Preliminary Cleaning
The first step was a preliminary cleaning, which consisted of eliminating those columns and rows that had no information. Also those columns that are not part of the hypothesis.

### Hyphotesis and Cleaning
In this part we have formulated the hypotheses and grouped those data that we need to answer the questions.

`HYPHOTESIS`

`1. The highest number of attacks occurred in the Northern Hemisphere in summer.`

`2. The highest number of attacks occurred in Australia.`

`3. Number of attacks depending on the water activity you are doing.`

### Visualization
Through these graphs we have responded to the hypotheses formulated.

1.

As can be seen in the graphs, the first hypothesis formulated is true, while the second is false.
